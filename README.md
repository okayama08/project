# THE YAMA TOKEN
OKAYAMA provides services and resources in exchange for YAMA token-an utility token that works on a DPoS algorithm. Each domain will connect to other domains based on contracts that provide the available services. A business gets its own network identity through which it can share and access data with others. Through a domain, users can operate on different governance models and create policies for their data. We provide provides support for large transactions, allowing building business services to become significantly less difficult with a system that reduces the resources required to develop and deploy the storage and processing of offchain documents.

# MANAGEMENT
In this context, management refers to the process of solving issues related to the consensus-building that cannot be resolved algorithmically. The main source of power in the OKAYAMA blockchain is the network token holder. More specifically, token holders transfer their power to the block producers and grant them limited and verifiable power to freeze accounts,search for and fix defective applications, and submit fork proposals to the basic protocol. The feature to designate block producers is embedded in the OKAYAMA software. When making changes to the blockchain, block manufacturers must approve them. When a block producer refuses to fulfill the wish of the token holders, they may initiate a vote to eliminate the producer. If the block producer makes changes without the permission of the network users, the testifiers of the full nodes reject the change process.

# MARKET OPPORTUNITIES
The governance structure provided by OKAYAMA will prove to be particularly useful to industries that rely on supply chain record keeping, which include the automobile, medicine, and cold-chain logistics industries, among others. The distributed ledger technology ensures that the information exchanged on the platform is accurate and secured during all steps of a transaction. As such, the buying process will be faster, as buyers wonâ€™t need to spend time searching for fake or hidden information; everything will be securely stored on the blockchain. The global cold chain market size is valued at over $167.99 billion and is expected to grow at 15.1% CAGR from 2019 to 2025. This strong market can benefit from IoT devices that ensure enhanced shipment safety by tracking specific metrics. Such devices can be connected to the OKAYAMA network, which will provide transparent information sharing through its distributed ledger technology. Another potential market is the automotive industry, which is gradually incorporating IoT technology in order to improve record keeping. It is estimated that over 20% of cars will be released on the market with an IoT solution by 2020. The OKAYAMA network can be used to store car data, making record keeping easier to manage. Participants in the fashion industry are also potential clients of OKAYAMA, as our platform can provide services for product management, production channels, and can help brands connect with their customers. For example, IoT products used on clothing products can function on the OKAYAMA platform, allowing the recording of all logistic operations. Through these recordings, the customers can check the history of the product and, as such, verify its authenticity, something which is often difficult and time consuming through traditional means.
